- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PrzemyslawRzepczynski

- I am a positive, happy and outgoing person that never gives up. I like to learn and develop my skills and are open to learn new technologies. I am a hardworking goal-oriented person that work good in a team, but also work good alone. 

I am looking for a starting position as a Junior Developer and are looking for a long-term place where I can learn and develop my skills as a programmer. Programming is my passion, and I am a self-taught JavaScript and React programmer. Currently, I am learning on Udemy and working on a big project that is a Netflix clone, but I am also working on some smaller projects so that I can continue to develop my skills.
